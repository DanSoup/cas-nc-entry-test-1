/*
  TASK 1



  PART 1: 
    
    Create a NEW array that has all the names with the correct capitalization. Each name
    should have the first letter be in UPPERCASE and the rest of the letters in LOWERCASE.

    susan => Susan
    vaneSSa => Vanessa
    
    Make sure you log your new array.


  PART 2:
    
    Create another NEW array that only contains names that begin with an "S". You should use
    the array you made in PART 1 so the names have the correct capitalization. Make sure you
    log your new array.


  PART 3:
  
    Create another NEW array that has all the names from the original array but backwards.

    Daniel => leinaD
    ROSS => SSOR

    For this part capitalization is not important. Make sure you log your new array.
